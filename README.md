# odin-recipes
This is the Project Recipes for The Odin Project.  On completion I will have set up a very basic HTML website using tags and elements.

End of project reflection.  I'm starting to understand now how much shortcuts, and copy-pasting information, are important for efficiency in writing code. I still need to work on that quite a bit to improve my speed and efficiency, I think practice will improve those skills.
